# 9READMEgen

## Description
    This app is to be used inside of your CLI to create a high quality README file.
    The application was built using JavaScript, Node.js, npm and the Inquirer package. 
    The application poses a series of questions asking you for the title of your project, a description,
    installation instructions, license type, usage for the application, contributors, testing instructions,
    and any contact information that maybe needed.
    
    
## Technologies
    For this project, I consulted various YouTube channels to help get started on some of the logic within the starter code.
    I also used VS Code, JavaScript, Node.js, inquirer, W3schools and JavaScript.info for documentation.
